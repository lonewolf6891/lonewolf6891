# Define classes for players, the game board, and game logic.
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, avatar):
        # Initialize player attributes (name, avatar, position, statistics, etc.)

class GameBoard:
    def __init__(self, size=100):
        # Initialize the game board with snakes and ladders.

class SnakesAndLaddersGame:
    def __init__(self, num_players=2):
        # Initialize the game with the specified number of players.

    def start_game(self):
        # Implement the main game loop with advanced features.

# Create instances of the game board, players, and the game.
board = GameBoard()
player1 = Player("Player 1", "avatar1.png")
player2 = Player("Player 2", "avatar2.png")
game = SnakesAndLaddersGame(num_players=2)

# Start the game.
game.start_game()
Keep in mind that implementing all these features can be quite involved and might require a good understanding of programming concepts. You can start by gradually adding these enhancements one at a time to your game to avoid getting overwhelmed. Additionally, you can find tutorials and resources online for each specific feature you want to implement to guide you through the process.
